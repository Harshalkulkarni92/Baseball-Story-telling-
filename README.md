# DATA STORY TELLING BASEBALL DATA

## INTRODUCTION

This report aims to present the explanatory data visualization steps and to communicate the findings and patterns on the performance of 
baseball players. The analysis is done using Tableau and a data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their 
handedness (right or left handed or both), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.

## SUMMARY
In this project I have used different visualization techniques to communicate insights on baseball data. I have analysed the relationships 
between variables, such as: batting average, height, weight, handedness and home runs.

## DESIGN

### INITAIL VERSION

For the first analysis I used box plot to show batting average and homerun with respect to handedness. I also used bar chart to show 
median average and homerun w.r.t handedness. I also used bubble chart to show distribution of homerun. My main aim was to go through 
all the parameters in the dataset After the initial findings I wanted to see if height and weight affect the performance of the player 
thus I decided to use line chart to explore the relation between height and batting average and homerun average.
Lastly I used scatter plot and found out that there was a weak positive correlation between homerun average and batting average

### FINAL VERSION 

I shared my first story on Reddit tableau community and got feedback from couple of people.
I have tried to implement all the changes suggested in the feedback, which includes creating histogram charts, renaming axis title, 
describing filters so the viewers can easily understand what they mean, adding some more insight with additional chart.

## FEEDBACK

Please check the pdf document above to see the feedback's that I received on my tableau story

## CONCLUTION

* I have found out that overall left handers perform slightly better than right handers in baseball.
* Also as the height increases the batting average and homerun average decreases.
* Players with height in between 70 to 76 inch and weight between 170 to 330 pounds have better performance then any other players.
* There is a positive correlation between batting average and homerun average but its not very strong.
